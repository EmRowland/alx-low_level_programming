# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays, and strings

This project is part of the ALX software engineering program. It focuses on further exploring pointers, arrays, and strings in C.

## Tasks

1. **0-memset.c**: Function that fills memory with a constant byte.
2. **1-memcpy.c**: Function that copies memory area.
3. **2-strchr.c**: Function that locates a character in a string.
4. **3-strspn.c**: Function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
5. **4-strpbrk.c**: Function that searches a string for any set of bytes.
6. **5-strstr.c**: Function that locates a substring.
7. **6-print_chessboard.c**: Function that prints the chessboard.
8. **7-print_diagsums.c**: Function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix.
9. **8-set_string.c**: Function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.
