# 0x0B. C - malloc, free

This project is part of the ALX software engineering program. It focuses on dynamic memory allocation in C.

## Tasks

1. **0-create_array.c**: Function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.
2. **1-strdup.c**: Function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
3. **2-str_concat.c**: Function that concatenates two strings.
4. **3-alloc_grid.c**: Function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.
5. **4-free_grid.c**: Function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.
6. **100-argstostr.c**: Function that concatenates all the arguments of your program.
